            <br>
            <li>5. If you check "Legal Alien Not Allowed to Work" or "Other," you must provide a document from a U.S. Federal, State, or local 
                government agency that explains why you need a Social Security number and that you meet all the requirements for the government 
                benefit. NOTE: Most agencies do not require that you have a Social Security number. Contact us to see if your reason qualifies for 
                a Social Security number. </li>
                <br>
            <li>6., 7. Providing race and ethnicity information is voluntary and is requested for informational and statistical purposes only. 
                Your choice whether to answer or not does not affect decisions we make on your application. If you do provide this 
                information, we will treat it very carefully. </li>
            <br>
            <li> 9.B., 10.B. If you are applying for an original Social Security card for a child under age 18, you MUST show the parents' Social 
                Security numbers unless the parent was never assigned a Social Security number. If the number is not known and you cannot 
                obtain it, check the "unknown" box. </li>
            <br>
            <li>13. If the date of birth you show in item 4 is different from the date of birth currently shown on your Social Security record, 
                show the date of birth currently shown on your record in item 13 and provide evidence to support the date of birth shown in 
                item 4. </li>

                completing the application, you must sign in item 17. If you are under age 18, you may either sign yourself, or a 
                parent or legal guardian may sign for you. If you are over age 18 and cannot sign on your own behalf, a legal guardian, 
                parent, or close relative may generally sign for you. If you cannot sign your name, you should sign with an "X" mark and 
                have two people sign as witnesses in the space beside the mark. Please do not alter your signature by including additional 
                information on the signature line as this may invalidate your application. Call us if you have questions about who may sign 
                your application.</li>
